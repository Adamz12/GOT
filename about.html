    <h2 class ="about-h2"> What is Game of Thrones?</h2>
    <p id="about-p">Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos. The series follows several simultaneous plot lines.</p> </div>
    <h2 class="about-h2">Should you watch it?</h2>
    <p>Game of Thrones has the finest plot in any TV show because audiences instantly become immersed in a vast and epic world without ever losing sight of the memorable characters that populate it. Game of Thrones is pretty much a must-watch for anyone who calls themselves a fan of television. Yes, it's a fantasy show; you have your dragons, kings, queens, knights, and all that. But when you get into the meat of the series, you'll find it's actually a drama story in disguise.</p>
