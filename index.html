   <h3 id="h3-left">Personally for me I have always been fascinated by history, the times of the kings, their wars, conspiracies and the politics surrounding those kingdoms. I have watched several movies like “Troy”, ”300”, but none of them can beat Game of thrones, mostly because of their portrayal of character, their deceitful plot and the uncertainty of the events.

    Everything seems so genuine and realistic. The castles, the dragons, their costumes, the wars. Thanks to the VFX team, they have done a really good job on this. But just the VFX won't ensure you a stable fan following base. You need to have some solid plot supported by some amusing unique personalities. They have been successful in creating some solid characters such as Ned Stark, The Deadly Viper, whom you think would survive the whole series because of their influence, however the next episode you realize they vanish. Consider the stark family, as per their deeds they should be living a happy life, because that’s what life teaches you. Karma, do good and good will come back to you. However GOT shows you the other side of life.

    Inshort the reason why people are obsessed with GOT is the modern touch that this suspenseful historical drama brings into our lives.</h3>
